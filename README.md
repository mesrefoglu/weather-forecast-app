# Weather Forecast App

## Overview

This is a simple forecast app I created using React, OpenWeatherMap API, and tailwindcss to learn how to work with public APIs and React.

I used tailwindcss for most of the frontend, tinkering with each element in UI until I felt satisfied that it looks good on the eyes. I used JS for the backend in order to get the information that I need from OpenWeatherMap.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript
- React
- Tailwindcss
- OpenWeatherMap
- JSON

## What was learned?

Most of my time was spent on changing the UI to fit my perfectionist eyes :) This led me to learn tailwindcss very well, and I can apply it on my next project very easily. Another blocker was trying to get API to work, and my mistake was trying to use their paid services. After using a student pass, I was able to get over that as well. I learned how to put and extract information from .json files.
